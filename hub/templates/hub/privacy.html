            <p>As our technical partner, mySociety (registered charity 1076346) acts as a data processor of the personal data described in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h2 id="collecting">What personal data we collect and how we use it</h2>

            <p>This privacy policy covers data collected on and by the Local Intelligence Hub. For information about personal data that might be collected elsewhere (such as when you sign up to one of our mailing lists), see the privacy policies of <a href="https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/privacy-policy">The Climate Coalition</a>, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/privacy/">mySociety</a>, and <a href="https://green-alliance.org.uk/privacy-policy/">Green Alliance</a>, respectively.</p>

            <h3>Information about you</h3>

            <p><strong>If you use the site without logging in</strong>, we collect and log some information about your visit, in order to analyse and fix problems with the site. Our webserver logs collect information about requests, including your IP address, data submitted (which might include your email address when you log on to the site), request date and time, page requested, browser version and referrer. We routinely keep this information for 28 days. Note that in normal circumstances, this data is infrequently accessed by a human, and when it is, they are likely to be assessing it in bulk, in order to understand an issue with the site, rather than at a granular level of individual users.</p>

            <p>We use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631">Google Analytics</a> software to collect non-personally-identifiable information about how you use the site. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements. We do not allow Google Analytics to store cookies on your device. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052">IP addresses are masked</a> (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information.</p>

            <p><strong>If you log into a personal account on the site</strong> (to enable personalised features such as access to members-only content) we store your name, organisation, email address, and a hash of your chosen password, in order to manage your access to the personalised features. We may also use this email address to send you occasional important messages about the service, or your account on it. When you log in, your email address may also be stored in our webserver logs for up to 28 days, as mentioned above. We store a cookie on your device, to keep you logged in over subsequent page loads and visits.</p>

            <p><strong>If you fill in our short, pop-up feedback form</strong> we don’t, by default, store any personal information about you. If you provide your email address (optional), we’ll use it to send you a follow-up survey in a few weeks, after which point, we’ll delete it. When you submit or skip the form, we store something similar to a cookie on your device, to prevent you from being shown the form again.</p>

            <p><strong>If you fill in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwTS3Mn9g5EOCBcFPF1uCXTbIJ69Tu5NA2kjUR0n-Hc1Knkw/viewform">full feedback form</a></strong> we don’t, by default, store any personal information about you. If you provide your email address (optional) or include any personal information in your feedback, then it will be stored for up to a year, to enable us to track problems over time, and contact you about fixes to issues you’ve reported.</p>

            <h3>Information about MPs</h3>

            <p>A number of the datasets we collect and provide on the Local Intelligence Hub include public domain information about MPs – things like MPs’ names, photos, election majorities, parliamentary group memberships, and social media handles. <a href="{% url 'sources' %}">The sources of this data are listed here.</a></p>

            <h2 id="legal-basis">Legal basis for processing</h2>

            <p>When you request a personal account on the site, you are consenting to the processes as described on this page. The legal basis is GDPR 6(1)(a) Consent of the data subject. You can withdraw this consent at any time by <a href="#erasure">deleting your account</a>.</p>

            <p>When you provide personal information via our feedback form, we process it under the legal basis GDPR 6(1)(a) Consent of the data subject. You can withdraw this consent at any time by <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contacting us</a>.</p>

            <p>If you are an MP, and your information has been used on the site, this is being stored under the legal basis of GDPR 6(1)(f) Legitimate interests. In our assessment, this is already public information about MPs, with a minimal privacy impact, being used in a way that MPs should reasonably expect, to provide a public benefit – transparency on what MPs do as part of their public role.</p>

            <p>When you interact with this site, information about the visit stored in our web server logs is stored under the basis of GDPR 6(1)(f) Legitimate interests. We collect this in order to analyse usage of the site, facilitate debugging and prevent abuse.</p>

            <h2 id="retention">How long we keep your data</h2>

            <p>In all cases listed above, we retain your personal data until such a time as it is removed from our upstream data sources (<a href="{% url 'sources' %}">listed here</a>) or you ask us to remove your details.</p>

            <p> As stated above, we retain information logged in our web server logs for 28 days.</p>

            <h2 id="sharing">Who we share your data with</h2>

            <p>If you have a personal account on the site, the personal details associated with your account (see above) are accessible only to three charities that run the site – The Climate Coalition, mySociety, and Green Alliance – and will only be used for the specific purpose of running the Local Intelligence Hub. We don’t share this personal data with any other charity, public body, or commercial organisation, unless you give us permission to do so, or we have to do so for legal or compliance reasons.</p>

            <h2 id="access">Your right to access</h2>

            <p>You may ask to see what personal data we hold about you, at any time. <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">Please email us</a> to request this.</p>

            <h2 id="erasure">Your right to erasure</h2>

            <p><strong>If you have an account on the site</strong> you can delete it via the <a href="{% url 'my_account' %}">Your account</a> page.</p>

            <p><strong>If you filled in one of our feedback forms</strong> but want us to remove your submission, you can <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">email us</a> to request this.</p>

            <h2 id="object">Your right to object</h2>

            <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data. <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">Please email us</a> to request this.</p>

            <h2 id="complain">Your right to complain</h2>
