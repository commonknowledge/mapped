            <p className="max-w-prose">During that process, it became apparent that a lot of the CRMâ€™s these organisations use have limited mapping tools. Their membership lists are mostly seen in a generic list format as you would expect from a spreadsheet but the ability to see their members in geographic context unlocks so much potential for organising.</p>
            <p className="max-w-prose">Thankfully, we were able to fill in this gap by building this feature into Mapped, getting us one step closer to our goal with our tool of empowering organisers</p>
